<h1 align="center">webcrack</h1>

webcrack is a tool for reverse engineering javascript.
It can deobfuscate [obfuscator.io](https://github.com/javascript-obfuscator/javascript-obfuscator), unminify,
and unpack [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)/[browserify](https://browserify.org/),
to resemble the original source code as much as possible.

Try it in the [online playground](https://webcrack.netlify.app/) or view the [documentation](https://webcrack.netlify.app/docs).

- 🚀 **Performance** - Especially for large files
- 🛡️ **Safety** - Considers variable references and scope
- 🔬 **Auto-detection** - Finds code patterns without needing a config
- ✍🏻 **Readability** - Removes obfuscator/bundler artifacts
- ⌨️ **TypeScript** - All code is written in TypeScript
- 🧪 **Tests** - To make sure nothing breaks
